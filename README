After having initialized the directory for our project, first thing we want to do is to initialize Node.js into that directory.
For that we will be using this command inside the terminal 
    npm init -y
Afterwards we need to install express by this command
    npm install express
And install jest for testing
    npm install jest supertest --save-dev

After having app.js api.js. and api.test.js initiated there is only one thing left to do before running tests - change the package.json configuration
inside script tag we have to change value of test to jest like shown - 
    "scripts": {
        //....
        "test": "jest"
        //....
    }

Finally we can run npm test command to see if we passed the tests or no.

in this project we have 4 different tests written
1. checking if /api route is working successfully and returning 200 status
2. checking if resposne from /api GET has property "message"
3. checking if / route is workiing successfully and returning 200 status
4. checking if resposne from / GET has property "message"
